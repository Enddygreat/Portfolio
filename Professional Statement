I am a highly motivated, go-getter, skillful, and detail-oriented cybersecurity specialist. I derive pleasure at what I do, where I identify potential risks, threats, and vulnerabilities to security and ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of assets, to help secure organizations and people alike purposefully.
